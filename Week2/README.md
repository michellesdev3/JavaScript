# Reading Material JavaScript1 Week 2

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 2:

1. [Conditional statements](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/conditional-statements)
2. [Loops](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/loops)
3. [Revisit debuggers](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/tools/debuggers)
4. [Naming conventions](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/naming-conventions)

## Week goals
All of the detailed information about every concept is in your study book. The following goal explanation will link you to the correct place to get studying. Read through the goal description once to get an idea of what you will be learning, then go through the different links and look at them in detail.

This week we are going to go a little deeper and get some extra building blocks to work with. That way we can make some more interesting pieces of code that actually have some logic in them. At this point we can determine things with our values and manipulate them, but the real power of programming comes when we can make 'decisions' to do something different based on our value. That way we can actually build logic into our code! Read all about conditional statements [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/conditional-statements). Another cool thing we can do in JavaScript is repeat actions, we can do that using a concept called loops, read more about that [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/loops).

There are a lot of things you can do with just these building blocks (next week you will get to know the last few to complete your arsenal). You will undoubtedly already have encountered the difficulty of reading code, and all the things we learned this week will make it even more difficult to follow. It is a good idea to revisit the debugger section with this new knowledge [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/tools/debuggers). Although it is called debugging, a lot of the process of finding 'bugs' in your code is trying to understand what is happening in the code. So keep using the debugger to understand pieces of code that you are not 100% comfortable with yet!

This is also the week we are going to start learning about best practices surrounding programming. These are general rules programmers follow so that code remains readable for others. The first will be about naming conventions, read more about that [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/naming-conventions). It will mention the term `functions`, which you haven't learned about yet, but keep that in mind for next week when you will be introduced to them!
