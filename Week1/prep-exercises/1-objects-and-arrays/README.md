# Prep exercise - Objects and Arrays

Objects and Arrays form the basis of pretty much all data structures in JavaScript and allow us to represent the state of the world to be manipulated. This exercise is all about how to represent objects in the real world in an 'IT' way. We will be offering different ways of storing regular objects and for each we would like you to think about the following questions:

- What are the advantages and disadvantages of having it represented in each way?
- Do you think there is another way of representing the object? If so, what is it and what do you see as the advantage of using that way?

Every real world scenario has its own `.js` file in this folder, go through them all.

## Things to think about

Next to thinking about each representation, also have a think about the following:

- In all of the examples, you will see that objects and arrays are mostly defined using a `const` statement rather than a `let` even if we change the value of the object or array, why do you think this is the case?
