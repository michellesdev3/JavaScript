## Week goals
All of the detailed information about every concept is in your study book. The following goal explanation will link you to the correct place to get studying. Read through the goal description once to get an idea of what you will be learning, then go through the different links (either from the agenda or this goal list).

This week is all about getting you started in the world of JavaScript. For that we have to go a little broad and first explain the difference between what you have been doing until now (very visual, one line does one thing coding) to actually programming. Start by opening your study book to the [What is programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/README) section and reading through it to get a feel for the world you are going to embark into. Once you know what programming is it is time to learn about the programmer niche this curriculum is built for which is [Web development](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/web-development). Now let's talk about JavaScript, which is the programming language the whole rest of the curriculum will be done in. First read up on what JavaScript is in your studybook [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/README).

Time to start learning the language with the first building blocks: variables! Have a look at what variables are [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/variables) and what values are [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/values). Then let's go over some syntax with the difference between statements and expressions [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/statements-vs-expressions). And finally let's look at what we can do with variables and values by using what's called operators. Read about them [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/operators).

To help learn the language we also want to introduce you to some tools that you can use to look under the hood of your code in the section about [debuggers](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/tools/debuggers). You won't understand everything of what's there yet, but debugging is so important we want you to look at it early. Read through it once and play around a bit in the debugger. We will be telling you to revisit the debugging section over the next few weeks as you start learning more and more about what is possible. 

Lastly we want to introduce the first steps to testing code with some code you will find in your exercises. Have a look at what assertion is [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/testing/assertion), the `console.assert` lines in your practice exercises uses this to check that your code does the right thing.

## Career training (part 1)
The goal of HYF is to get you a job, not just teach you how to program. That means that we also want to train you into how to present yourself to potential companies.

In this or the next week there will be a mandatory meeting where we will go through what we call `your personal brand`. You do not need to prepare anything for this first meeting, keep an eye on your class channel for what day this meeting will be!

## Finished?

Are you finished with going through the materials? You're doing great! If you feel ready to get practical, click [here](./MAKEME.md). If you have finished the exercises, then start working on week 2! The first 3 weeks of this module cover all the basic building blocks of JavaScript and getting familiar with them is of the utmost importance!
