# Homework JavaScript Week 1

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Set up class repository

Practice, practice, practice. This week you are not handing in any homework, but are going to practice as much javascript as you can. Play around with the exercises mentioned below, remember that you can copy the code into [JS Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) to step through the code. Or look at it in the debugger in the browser/vscode.

## 1. Practice the concepts

Before we learn how to build actual applications, we first need to gain experience using JavaScript in a computational way. This teaches us how to think like a programmer, and gives us more experience with the language itself.

In the following exercises you'll learn how to use different JavaScript concepts to solve common computational problems.

- [Learn-js](https://www.learn-js.org/). Do all the `Learn the basics` exercises.
- [Codecademy: Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript/modules/learn-javascript-introduction). Do all the exercises (#1 to #10).
- [jshero.net](https://www.jshero.net/en/success.html). Do the first 5 exercises.

The above should give you a nice basis. If you have extra time and are still a little unsure, have a look at the following:
- [FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript). Do at least 20 exercises, you can choose whichever ones you feel are challenging enough.
- There is a practice-exercises folder in this week's repository that is filled with exercises to try out. The solutions are in a separate folder so you can check if you did it correctly. Clone this repository to your computer and have a go!

## 2. Set up class repository

This week you will also get invited to your class repository and get an issue assigned to you. Read through the issue and take the steps to set up your environment for the rest of the curriculum!

## No homework to hand in

For the first 2 weeks of JavaScript there is no homework to hand in as the exercises already give you all the feedback you need. Go through the first 3 weeks at your own pace, and feel free to ask questions about any of the 3 weeks for the Q&A sessions.

## Done early?

Try to do more exercises in the links above. The first weeks of the JavaScript modules are very important as understanding the basics will make the rest of the curriculum that much easier to follow. So keep reading and writing code! If you are done early, go on to week 2!
