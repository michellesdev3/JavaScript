/** 
 * Follow the commented steps to write a piece of code.
 */

// 1. Declare variable and assign to it an empty array. Make sure that the name of the variable indicates it contains more than 1 item. For example items instead of item.
const items = [];

// 2. Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
console.log('I think the items array will be an empty array as it has been initialised like that');

// 3. Write a console.log statement that logs the array.
console.log(items);

// 4. Create a new variable with an array that has 3 of your favorite animals, each in a different string. Make sure the name of the variables says something about what the variable contains.
const animals = ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Mouse'];

// 5. Write a console.log statement that logs the second array.
console.log(animals);

// 6. Add a statement that adds another string ("Piglet)" to the array of animals.
animals.push('Piglet');

// 7. Write a console.log statement that logs the second array!
console.log(animals);
