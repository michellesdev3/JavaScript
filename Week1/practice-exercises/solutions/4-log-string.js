// 1. Declare a variable myString and assign a string to it. Use your full name, including spaces, as the content for the string.
let myString = 'John Doe';

// 2. Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.
console.log('I think the value of the string is John Doe as I assigned it immediately');

// 3. Now console.log the variable myString.
console.log(myString);


// 4. Now reassign to the variable myString a new string.
myString = 'Jane';

// 5. Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.
console.log('I think the value of the string is Jane as I reassigned it');

// 6. Now console.log myString again.
console.log(myString);
