# Homework JavaScript Week 4

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Homework exercises
3. Challenges

## **1. Practice the concepts**

Before we head into the homework exercises, it might be nice to do some interactive exercises first! In the following resource you'll find some exercises that'll teach you all about higher order and array functions!

- [Learn JavaScript: Iterators](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript/modules/learn-javascript-iterators)

## **2. Homework exercises**

This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (JavaScript / Week 4). Have a look at your class repository on how to hand in the homework. 

## **3. Challenges**

Have a look at the challenges folder in this repository to try some harder problems. We expect these to be hard, so take your time to try and solve them yourself. If you really can't figure it out then have a look at the solutions, but it usually sticks better if you find the solution yourself.
 
## Finished?

So you think you are a JavaScript superstar now huh? :wink:

Once you have finished the homework there are a couple of things you can keep doing to improve your JavaScript and problem solving skills. Have a look at the following and come back to them later in the curriculum, it is never bad to do these exercises!

- [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript)
Exercism has a JavaScript track that has some nice exercises to practice your skills. The easy ones will be similar to what you have done the past weeks, but the hard ones may take some working together to fix.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
Project Euler defines problems that you can use your new JavaScript knowledge to find solutions for. These start off doable with the knowledge you have now and will get more and more difficult. You can come back to it later if you get stuck, or ask your classmates! Whenever you have some time or want to practice problem solving this is a good place to go.
