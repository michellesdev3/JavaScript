# Reading Material JavaScript Week 4

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 4:

1. [Higher Order Functions](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/higher-order-functions)
   - Array methods
   - Arrow functions
2. [Closures](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/closures)
   - Execution context
   - Why do we need closures?
3. [Problem solving](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/problem-solving-process)

## Week goals

This week we are going to keep practicing coding and introducing a few more advanced topics that you will encounter. So a little less reading, more practicing! Firstly, higher order functions are a way functions are being used regularly in the real world, most notably in the methods `Array`'s provide us. Read all about it [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/higher-order-functions). Secondly, JavaScript has a thing called closures which you should know about. You will not encounter issues with them any time soon, but it is good to have in the back of your mind that this exists. So read all about them [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/closures).

Now that we are getting into more and more complex code it is also a good idea to learn a structured way to solve more complex problems. Have a look at the page on problem solving in your study book over [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/problem-solving-process).

After that it is time to start practicing again, make as many exercises as you can in the list [here](./MAKEME.md) and don't forget to hand in your homework. There will also be a test coming up for this module. What and when will be announced in your class channel, so keep an eye on that as usual! The best way to prepare is to keep programming!
