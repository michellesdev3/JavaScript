# Prep exercise - banking

This week is all about combining everything we know and learning how to solve problems. To help with that, we're going to do a very difficult exercise with a lot of moving parts. As it is a prep exercise, it is something you can do together to get to the solution! Have a look at the `index.js` file for the instructions.

## Things to think about

- Why do you think the `onSuccess` and `onFail` callback functions were used? What is the advantage of that?
- Did you create extra functions? Why or why not?
- How would you test this code?
