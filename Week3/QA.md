# Q & A Session

The first 2 weeks of JavaScript we do not have homework and we encourage students to follow all the material at their own pace. So students can ask questions about any week. Expect questions about:

- Functions
- Scope
- The Debugger (both browser/vscode) and how to debug functions
- DRY principle
- Naming conventions

In these first weeks we want to get the students to create the right mental model for JavaScript constructs, so try to go back to basics as much as possible. However easy it comes to the mentors, this is the first time students encounter all the syntax of a programming language. So try to go slowly and use the debugger / [JSTutor](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) as much as possible.
