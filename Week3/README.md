3. [Modern JS](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/modern-js)
4. [Continue with Your personal brand](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand)
5. [Testing code](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/the-testing-planet-2017/lessons/so-what-is-software-testing)
   - [Assertion](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/testing/assertion)

## Week goals
This week is the last week of explaining all the basic building blocks that JavaScript offers for you to work with. The last one is called functions, read all about them [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/functions). Functions bring along with them a concept called the scope that you may have encountered a bit last week but we want to explicitely explain now. Read about scope [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/scope).

These things will take the power of what you can do to another level, as it allows you to group a certain set of lines of code into a single 'action' to take. Making it reusable in other places as well helping you organise your code, which will help a lot when you start writing more and more code. 

Now that you have learned all the basic blocks it is time to tell you about the different versions of JavaScript. JavaScript has been evolving over its lifetime and certain syntax has been added. Have a look in your study book at the topic of what is called 'Modern JS' [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/modern-js). Throughout the curriculum we will be expecting you to use the modern syntax as that is most likely what you will be programming in. There is also a section on the history of JavaScript in there, you do not need to know this but we recommend it if you have some time to spare as it is very interesting.

Lastly we want to introduce the first steps to testing code. Let's first have a look at what software testing is and why we do it [here](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/the-testing-planet-2017/lessons/so-what-is-software-testing). The simplest form of testing is using assertions, have a look what that is [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/testing/assertion), we will introduce this more in your homework.

Also, don't forget about the [personal brand repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand) if you didn't manage to complete it last week.

## Finished?

Are you finished with going through the materials? Give yourself a pat on the back because you rock! It is time to combine everything you have learned and start practicing them vigorously. Have a look at the exercises [here](./MAKEME.md) and try to make as many of them as you can. This week there will be homework to do and hand in, so don't forget to do that! If you haven't set up the homework repository yet, have a look at your class repo.
