# Reading Material JavaScript Week 3

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 3:

1. [Functions](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/functions)
2. [Scope](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/scope)
3. [DRY Principle](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/dont-repeat-yourself)

## Week goals
This week is the last week of explaining all the basic building blocks that JavaScript offers for you to work with. The last one is called functions, read all about them [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/functions). Functions bring along with them a concept called the scope that you may have encountered a bit last week but we want to explicitely explain now. Read about scope [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/scope). 

These things will take the power of what you can do to another level, as it allows you to group a certain set of lines of code into a single 'action' to take. Making it reusable in other places as well helping you organise your code, which will help a lot when you start writing more and more code. This also brings us to another principle of programming that we want you to get into the habit of doing, that is the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Read about that [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/dont-repeat-yourself)!

It is time to combine everything you have learned and start practicing them vigorously. Have a look at the exercises [here](./MAKEME.md) and try to make as many of them as you can. This week there will be homework to do and hand in, so don't forget to do that!
