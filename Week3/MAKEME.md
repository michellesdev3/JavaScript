# Homework JavaScript Week 3

This will be the first week you are expected to hand in some homework when we combine all of the concepts you have been practicing the last 3 weeks.

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Prep exercises
3. Homework exercises
4. Your personal brand

## **1. Practice the concepts**

In this section you will be doing interactive exercises that will allow you to practice with the concepts you've learned about this week. In the first course you'll learn about functions, the structure and how they're used. They are a fundamental part of understanding programming and you should become very familiar with them! Do as many of the things in the following list to feel comfortable with the concepts.

## **2. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your class and your Q&A mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `JavaScript` fork, go to the folder `Week3`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **3. Homework exercises**

It is time to combine everything we have learned the past couple of weeks and get some feedback from experienced developers. This will be the first week you are working with the [homework repository](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Homework/blob/main/README.md) so reserve some time to set it up. This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (JavaScript / Week 3). Have a look at the [homework guide](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/blob/main/hand-in-homework-guide.md) to see how to hand in your homework.

_NOTE: Make sure to read and apply all of the README in the homework repository to set up the extensions in Visual Studio Code!_.

## **4. Your personal brand**

Remember that next week you have to hand in your CV! If you havenâ€™t started yet, this is the last reminder :)

## Done early?
