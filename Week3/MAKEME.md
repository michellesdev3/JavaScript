# Homework JavaScript Week 3

This will be the first week you are expected to hand in some homework when we combine all of the concepts you have been practicing the last 3 weeks.

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Homework exercises

## **1. Practice the concepts**

In this section you will be doing interactive exercises that will allow you to practice with the concepts you've learned about this week. In the first course you'll learn about functions, the structure and how they're used. They are a fundamental part of understanding programming and you should become very familiar with them! Do as many of the things in the following list to feel comfortable with the concepts.

- [Codecademy: Functions ](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions)
- There is a practice-exercises folder in this week's repository that is filled with exercises to try out. The solutions are in a separate folder so you can check if you did it correctly. Clone this repository to your computer and have a go!

## **2. Homework exercises**

It is time to combine everything we have learned the past couple of weeks and get some feedback from experienced developers. This will be the first week you are working with the [homework repository](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Homework/blob/main/README.md) so reserve some time to set it up. *Make sure to read the README in the repository to set up the extensions*. This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (JavaScript / Week 3). Have a look at your class repository on how to get the homework repository set up and how to hand in the homework.
